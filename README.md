# Ethno Botanicus Bot
Discord bot for identifying plants from pictures and listing their taxonomy, chemical composition, uses and genomes


## Usage:
1. Setup a new application and bot with the privileged message read intend, text permissions and moderator permission on discord and copy the token.  
2. Enter the token in `bot.py`.
3. Run the bot (main.py).
4. Use the discord command `!taxonomy <Scientific plant name here>` to learn more about a plant.  
5. Use the discord command `!identify` with an image attached (uploaded) to identify the plant and learn more about it.  

## Coming soon
- Detailed description of the plant and it's usage (!taxonomy:detailed)
- Listing of genomes and proteins for the plant (!genomes)
- Listing of chemical composition and toxicity analysis (metabolism and receptor target prediction).  

### Future research
- DNA target / biosynthesis prediction for CRISPR/CAS9 based GMO suggesting edits to chloroplasts in order to change photosynthesis to alter chemical composition of plant.  

## Credits
This bot makes use public APIs and opendata.  
I thank all researchers and institutions for providing the world with this data, without it this bot would not function.  
Special thanks goes out to: 
- World Flora Online
- IPNI
- Kew botanical gardens
- National Center for Biotechnology Information
- Pl@ntNet
- Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam (For inspiring me to build this bot)
